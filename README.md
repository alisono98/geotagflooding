# Geotagging Flood Images 

**Objective:** To leverage publicly shared images from social media to provide real-time information to users of navigation apps about flooded areas.

**Inspiration:** Flooded regions can present significant physical and biological hazards to individuals who inadvertently enter them. Our goal is to enhance safety by proactively informing users about which areas to avoid, helping to protect them from potential dangers.
